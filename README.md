# Short Shell Scripts
## Overview
This is a collection of short shell scripts that I have created for personal use. Most scripts are more useful when linked to /usr/local/bin so that they can be run globally.
* __helloworld.sh__ - My first script, loads "Hello World".
* __webtemplate.sh__ - _Takes 1 Arg_, _called globally as 'mkweb' on my PC_, creates a new directory with the name provided, filled with boilerplate HTML, CSS and JS code.
* __killdiscord.sh__ - _Called globally as 'kdiscord' on my PC_, kills the discord application (it freezes sometimes) and immediately reopens it.
* __scripttemplate.sh__ - _Called globalled as 'mkshell' on my PC_, makes a shell script with the correct template and permissions.
* __promptcustomiser.sh__ - Runs through the process of changing the PS1 and appending it to bash.rc. Has different colour options, an option to include the header or not and an option set a default starting directory.

Some of these might need tweaking for different systems, but they are very short so that will not be difficult or time-consuming.
