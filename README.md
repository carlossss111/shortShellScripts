# Short Shell Scripts
## Overview
This is a collection of short shell scripts that I have created for personal use. Most scripts are more useful when linked to /usr/local/bin so that they can be run globally.
* __helloworld.sh__ - My first script, loads "Hello World".
* __webtemplate.sh__ - _Takes 1 Arg_, _called globally as 'mkweb' on my PC_, creates a new directory with the name provided, filled with boilerplate HTML, CSS and JS code.
* __killdiscord.sh__ - _Called globally as 'kdiscord' on my PC_, kills the discord application (it freezes sometimes) and immediately reopens it.
* __scripttemplate.sh__ - _Called globally as 'mkshell' on my PC_, makes a shell script with the correct template and permissions.
* __Ctemplate.sh__ - _Called globally as 'mkc' on my PC_ makes a file with the C program boilerplate.
* __promptcustomiser.sh__ - Runs through the process of changing the PS1 and appending it to bash.rc. Has different colour options, an option to include the header or not and an option set a default starting directory.
* __themeswitcher.sh__ - _Called globally as 'darkmode' on my PC_, switches between a dark theme and a light theme for the GUI (Linux Mint Cinnamon). The two themes can be edited through the variables at the very beginning of the script if needed.
* __newvimwindow.sh__ - _Called globally as 'nvim' on my PC_, loads the vim text editor in another terminal window so I can have two terminals on the go at once with less effort.

Some of these might need tweaking for different systems, but they are very short so that will not be difficult or time-consuming.
